 I downloaded Git Git - Install for Windows
2. for the installation I added to path, and got git bash 
3. Cloned my repo from GitHub online to my computer using GitHub desktop 
4. Right click location of local repo and selected open gitbash here 
5. typed in "git lfs install" into git bash 
6. typed in "git lfs track "*.psd" " 
7. Push local repo to the git server one using gtihub desktop and a commit 
on the website I edited the new .gitattribute file to one that is unity based .gitattributes for Unity3D with git-lfs
Pulled the server one into my local using GitHub desktop and using fetch origin 
moved my game files ( assets, logs, library, packages, etc. ) into my local repo location 
committed and pushed

For collisions in unity to occur: 
BOTH objects need a collider, this can be 3D ( box, capsule, sphere) or 2d ( square, circle etc) 
One object needs a rigid body either 3D or 2d
Rigid body controls both collision and physics. If you don't want physics ( gravity and force) set your ridged body to kinematic instead of dynamic 
If you have mismatched things it wont work ( 2d collider and 3d rigidbody ) make sure it's all consistent. Finally, if your script asks you for a trigger collision, set  the collider to trigger
